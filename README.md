This is a Clone of the Reebok Site Homepage, that I used to practice with React.js, Material-UI, and CSS. My intent was to further my understanding and ability with Material UI and get as close to the functionailty and asthetic of the original site as possible. 

Images and Video Assets that I didn't feel comfortable copying from the site for obvious copyright reasons were replaced with stock photos and video. The appropriate artists have been attributed here.

Images for products were copied from the original website for educational and demonstration use only, they were used to simulate the product display elements of the site.

Currently the product carousels do not work properly, the function is correct but the movement is off, it is next on my slate to fix.

No infringement of copyrighted material was intended in the project though proprietary images may have been used to demonstrate coding layout and visual representation of the code utilized. 
This build is not intended for production.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
